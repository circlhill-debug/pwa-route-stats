# Working Agenda

Updated: 2025-09-19

Phase 3 (stay the course)
- Today tiles: raw vs last same weekday (worked). Keep simple and reliable.
- Weekly day-by-day: cumulative Mon..today vs last Mon..today in the Hours/Parcels/Letters panels.
- Mix Viz: keep current compare + baseline drift sparkline; no extra baseline charts.

Immediate tasks
- Percentages: align W1=W0 (Mon..today) vs W2 (last same range) across all compares; ensure labels are consistent.
- Baseline compare: keep weekday alignment and min guards; surface “days used”.
- Reliability: continue guarding UI sections so settings toggles cannot hide entire cards due to a minor error.

Stretch (after Phase 3)
- Optional volatility (z-scores) view — separate toggle; only if needed.
